## How to Run

<br>

**To run the ML notebook:**
With Docker installed and running, build the Docker image with the following command

<br>

```
docker build -t churn-app .
```

<br>

And run it

<br>

```
docker run -p 8501 churn-app
```

## Introduction

This repository was made to build a classifier that predicts Churn rates and displays data using the streamlit web framework.

<br/>

The data was collected from [this database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/telecom-customer-churn-insights-for-analysis) and it was cleaned and resampled to have a better representation of the minority class.
After that, I built a RF Classifier that predicted Churn with 89,3% precision in the validation set. The data was displayed in an app with Streamlit. 

<br/>


## Results

**Images of the application that can be acessed with [this link](https://churn-dash.streamlit.app/).**

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading up until here. I had a ton of fun doing this notebook and got a lot of useful insights on Unbalanced data and how to work with Streamlit applications.
